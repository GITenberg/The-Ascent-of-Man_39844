description: Renowned German poet Mathilde Blind published several influential volumes
  of verse in the late nineteenth century. The epic poem The Ascent of Man is her
  most ambitious literary undertaking. In it, she provides a poetic account of Charles
  Darwin's theory of evolution. A relic from the era when the arts and sciences were
  more deeply intertwined, this fascinating work is a must-read for fans of Romantic
  poetry.
